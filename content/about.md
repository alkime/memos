# About Memos

Memos is a voice-to-blog platform that transforms spoken words into published content.

## Our Mission

We believe that creating content should be as natural as having a conversation. By removing the friction between thought and publication, we empower more people to share their ideas with the world.

## The Platform

Built on modern, proven technologies:

- **Hugo** for lightning-fast static site generation
- **Go** for a robust, performant web server
- **Fly.io** for global deployment and edge delivery

## Current Status

We're currently in Phase I of development, establishing the core infrastructure. Future phases will introduce:

- Voice recording capabilities
- AI-powered transcription
- Automated content formatting
- Multi-format publishing

## Get Involved

This is an open-source project. We welcome contributions, feedback, and ideas from the community.
