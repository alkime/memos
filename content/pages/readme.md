# README

Hi I’m James. I’m a software engineer in San Francisco. Been at it almost 20 years, and am finally getting a website together haha.

This site is a learning experiment, built by hand (to a certain level…) as a means to help me better understand the technologies I’m using to build it, and the technologies that augment the craft of building it.

This latter bit is site's primary focus and the deepest well of eurekas. AI is really shuffling the deck across so many fields and building software isn’t immune. Building something—this site—is the best way to learn about AI assisted coding, AI DevEx, agentic coding, whatever you'd like to call it. (not vibecoding!! 1-shot ==> serious app is a myth IMO, at least for now!)

You can read up a bit more about this in depth in the first post: [Start With Why](/posts/2025/10/start-with-why) and you can read more about my professional background in my [resume](/pages/resume) to see where I'm coming from.

Thanks for stopping by.
