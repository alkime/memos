{"id":"memos-hx7.3","title":"Create implementor agent","description":"# Plan: Create Implementor Agent\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd an \"implementor\" agent as the execution counterpart to the architect agent. While the architect explores and plans (creating beads), the implementor picks up ready tasks and completes them with proper verification and git hygiene.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\nBased on clarifications:\n- **Single task per invocation** - User controls when to run again\n- **Epic scoping** - User specifies which epic to work within; agent asks if confused\n- **Verification** - Run `make check` (tests + lint) before closing\n- **Git commits** - Create a commit after successfully closing each task\n- **Discovered work** - Use `discovered-from` dependency when finding new issues\n\n## Agent Workflow\n\n```\n1. Resolve Epic Context\n   - User specifies epic name/ID in prompt\n   - If ambiguous, use AskUserQuestion to clarify\n\n2. Find Ready Work\n   - bd ready --parent=\u003cepic-id\u003e --limit=1\n   - If no ready tasks, report completion\n\n3. Claim the Task\n   - bd show \u003ctask-id\u003e to read full details\n   - bd update \u003ctask-id\u003e --claim (atomic: sets assignee + in_progress)\n\n4. Execute the Task\n   - Read task description carefully\n   - Explore codebase as needed\n   - Make implementation changes\n   - Follow project patterns (CLAUDE.md, style guide)\n\n5. Verify\n   - Run: make check (or equivalent from CLAUDE.md)\n   - If verification fails, fix issues before proceeding\n   - Do NOT close task if tests/lint fail\n\n6. Track Discoveries\n   - If bugs, TODOs, or related work found:\n     - bd create --title=\"...\" --type=task --parent=\u003cepic-id\u003e\n     - bd dep add \u003cnew-id\u003e --deps=\"discovered-from:\u003ccurrent-task-id\u003e\"\n\n7. Complete\n   - bd close \u003ctask-id\u003e --reason=\"\u003cwhat was done\u003e\"\n   - git add + commit with descriptive message\n   - bd sync --from-main\n\n8. Report\n   - Summarize what was accomplished\n   - List any discovered work created\n   - Note remaining ready tasks in epic\n```\n\n## File to Create\n\n**Path:** `.claude/agents/implementor.md`\n\n**Structure:**\n- YAML frontmatter (name, description with examples, model: sonnet, color)\n- Core workflow matching above\n- Guidelines section\n- Anti-patterns to avoid\n\n## Key Differences from Reference (beads task-agent)\n\n| Aspect | Reference Agent | Our Implementor |\n|--------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Scope | Loops through all ready work | Single task per invocation |\n| Context | Global ready queue | Scoped to user-specified epic |\n| Verification | Optional/task-specific | Always runs make check |\n| Git | No commits | Commits after each task |\n| Model | Unspecified | Sonnet (architect uses Opus) |\n\n## Verification\n\nAfter creating the agent file:\n1. Add a new task to the epic: `bd create --title=\"Create implementor agent\" --type=task --parent=memos-hx7`\n2. Verify the agent file renders correctly in Claude Code settings\n3. Test invocation: spawn the implementor agent and confirm it can find ready work\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"james@alki.me","created_at":"2026-01-17T17:06:07.625561-08:00","created_by":"James McKernan","updated_at":"2026-01-17T17:06:07.625561-08:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"memos-hx7.3","depends_on_id":"memos-hx7","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-17T17:06:07.626754-08:00","created_by":"James McKernan"}]}
