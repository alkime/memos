# Alkime Memos

A voice-to-blog platform built as a learning experiment in AI-assisted development.

This project explores what it's like to build and ship software with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) as a development partner—from architecture decisions to implementation to documentation. The codebase itself is an artifact of that exploration.

**What it does:** Record voice memos → transcribe with Whisper → draft with Claude → publish to a static Hugo blog on Fly.io.

**What it's for:** Developing a point of view on AI-assisted DevEx, specifically with Claude Code.
